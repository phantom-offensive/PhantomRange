PhantomShop is a fully functional online fashion store with **50 hidden security vulnerabilities** across **18 categories**. Built for security professionals, students, and CTF enthusiasts who want hands-on practice exploiting real-world web application flaws — not contrived textbook examples.

Every vulnerability is embedded naturally into working e-commerce features: product search, checkout, user profiles, admin panels, APIs, and more.

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phantom-offensive/PhantomRange.git
cd PhantomRange
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:9000
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phantom-offensive/PhantomRange.git
cd PhantomRange
make run
# Or: go run ./cmd/server/
```

### Using Make

```bash
make build          # Compile binary
make run            # Build and run
make docker-build   # Build Docker image
make docker-run     # Start with Docker Compose
make docker-stop    # Stop containers
make reset-db       # Wipe database (re-seeds on restart)
```

**Requirements:** Go 1.25+ or Docker

## How It Works

Every flag follows the format:

```
FLAG{s0m3th1ng_h3r3}
```

**Find flags** by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application. **Submit flags** via the scoreboard UI or API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/flag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"flag":"FLAG{...}"}'
```

Track your progress at `http://localhost:9000/scoreboard`.

### Difficulty Breakdown

| Difficulty | Flags | What to Expect |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Easy | 12 | Foundational attacks, minimal tooling |
| Medium | 24 | Requires tools and technique chaining |
| Hard | 14 | Advanced exploitation, creative thinking |

## Recommended Tools

- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) — HTTP proxy and scanner
- [curl](https://curl.se/) — Command-line HTTP client
- [sqlmap](https://sqlmap.org/) — SQL injection automation
- [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) — Web fuzzer
- [Python](https://python.org) — Scripting exploits
- Browser DevTools — Inspect requests, cookies, DOM

---

## Tips

- Explore every feature as a normal user first
- Check all input fields, URL parameters, cookies, and headers
- Look at HTTP responses carefully — errors and headers reveal information
- Not every vulnerability is on a web page — check the API too
- Some flags require chaining multiple vulnerabilities
- The admin panel exists, but you need to find your way in

## Architecture

```
PhantomRange/
  cmd/server/         Entry point
  internal/
    db/               SQLite database, schema, seed data
    shop/             HTTP handlers, routes, templates, static assets
  data/               Database file (auto-created)
  docs/               Screenshots
```

Single binary, zero config. Uses Go standard library + SQLite (pure Go driver). Database auto-seeds on first run with test users, products, coupons, and all 50 flags.
